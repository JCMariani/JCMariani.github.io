### Abstract

Creatine Transporter Deficiency (CTD) is an X‐linked disease due to the loss of SLC6A8 gene and presenting with low brain creatine, intellectual disability, autistic‐like behavior and seizures. No treatments  are  available  yet  for  CTD,  and  little  is  known  about  the  brain  circuit  alterations underlying  its  pathological  endophenotypes.  Here,  we  tracked  brain  network  and  behavioral dysfunction in a murine model of CTD at two stages of disease progression. fMRI mapping revealed widespread disruption of brain connectivity in Slc6a8‐KO mutants, with prominent somato‐motor dysconnectivity  in  juvenile  mice,  and  weaker  and  more  focal  cortical  and  subcortical hypoconnectivity  in  adults.  Notably,  perinatal  AAV‐mediated  expression  of  human  SLC6A8  in Slc6a8‐KO mutants significantly rescued juvenile fMRI hypoconnectivity. This effect was paralleled by  a  regression  of  translationally  relevant  phenotypes,  including  a  reduction  in  stereotyped movements  and  increased  body weight which  persisted  into  adulthood.  Cognitive  deficits  and residual fMRI hypoconnectivity in adult mice were instead not reverted by gene therapy. Finally, multivariate  modeling  in  adult  mice  revealed  a  basal  forebrain  network  whose  activity  was associated  with  behavioral  performance,  and  modulated  by  brain  creatine  levels.  This  brain‐behavior relationship was disrupted in Slc6a8‐KO mutants. Our results document robust network disruption  in  CTD  and  demonstrate  that  CTD  pathology  can  be  partially  reversed  by  perinatal genetic expression of SLC6A8, thus laying the basis for the development of experimental therapies for this genetic disorder.
