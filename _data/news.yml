  extended: "We investigated the fingerprint of opioids on awake, behaving mice FC. We demonstrate some static FC dysconnection, morphine injection inducing the apparition of two main anticorrelated super-synchronous networks: thalamo-cortical vs. thalamo-hippocampal. In addition we show that this pattern is explained by a rich spatio temporal reorganisation of brain aemodynamics. Finally we link this fingerprint to MOR activation and describe a two steps process, where injection initiates a fast, transient hyperemia concurrently with hyperlocomotor event; These first 10min are followed by a more gradual shift of FC which matches analgesia and phosphorylation of the receptor dynamics."

  extended: "Using an amazing dataset aquired by Chiara Pepe, I investigated the properties of FC networks in anaesthetised mice measured with fUSI. In addition to recapitulate fMRI typical RSNs, we showed that FC patterns co-vary with structural connectivity, acounting for 55.6% of the total variance of Structural Functional connectivity matrix. Finally by investigating the dynamical features of these signals, we showed that recently described [CMODES](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2023/07/19/2023.07.19.549681.full.pdf) can be defined as attractors of the two steps CAPs transition dynamics."
