  extended: We investigated the fingerprint of opioids on awake, behaving mice FC. We demonstrate some static FC dysconnection, morphine injection inducing the apparition of two main anticorrelated super-synchronous networks: thalamo-cortical vs. thalamo-hippocampal. In addition we show that this pattern is explained by a rich spatio temporal reorganisation of brain aemodynamics. Finally we link this fingerprint to MOR activation and describe a two steps process, where injection initiates a fast, transient hypermia concurrently with hyperlocomotor event; These first 10min are floowed by a more gradual shift of FC which matches analgesia and phosphorylation of the recptor dynamics. ![image](https://JCMariani.github.io/assets/img/2024-08-01_BioRxiv_Opioids.png)
