My name is Jean/Charles Mariani. I am a postdoctoral researcher in Alessandro Gozzi's [Functional Neuroimaging Lab](https://www.iit.it/it/web/functional-neuroimaging) at the Italian Institute of Technology (Italiano Istituto di Tecnologia - IIT) in Rovereto, Trentino (TN), Italy. After a bachelor in french preparatory school on mathematics and theoretical computer sciencem, I graduated from engineering with the 133<sup>th</sup> cohort of [ESPCI](https://www.espci.psl.eu/en/), I later specialised in Neurotechnology at the [Imperial College of London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) before pursuing a PhD in Zsolt Lenkei's team on functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI). I demonstrated the possiblity to scale this technology up for the investigation of fingerprints of pharmacological compounds on functional connectivity in awake mice. 

I am now following up on this work by studying the emergence of dynamical patterns in both functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and fUSI. My work remains at the interface of experiments for which I bring counsels to optimise the yield of fUSI and analyst with a particular expertis on signal processing. Nevertheless, my main effort is focused on the development of dynamic generative models of the mouse brain. I have a specific interest in the role of neuromodulation to explain haemodynamics and the Thalamus influence in modulating cortical activity.
