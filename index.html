    <h2><a href="https://JCMariani.github.io/PhD.html">There is my PhD thesis</a></h2>

In a nutshell:

      Using fUSI to image awake mouse while injecting them some drugs. I studied mainly FC under the influence of opioids, cannabinoids and psilocybin in the hope to find fingerprints of these various pharmacological compounds (spoiler alert: we might have found one or two).
      <br>
      In this section, I detail the thesis content and give some tips for putative curious readers that would like to know more on neuroimaging in general, then fUSI in particular, FC and other topics orbiting around my work in <a href="https://ipnp.paris5.inserm.fr/research/teams-and-projects/21-team-lenkei">Zsolt Lenkei's lab<a/>.
