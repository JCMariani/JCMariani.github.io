This post is adapted from this [**X** thread](https://x.com/ZsoltLenkei/status/1818995234258157944) by [@ZsoltLenkei](https://x.com/ZsoltLenkei) about the main results of my PhD thesis published as a [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.30.604249v1) on BioRxiv server.

I will explain breifly here the main points of [Mariani et al. 2024](https://JCMariani.github.io/05_Opioid-brains_Mariani).
