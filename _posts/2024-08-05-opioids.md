This post is adapted from this [**X** thread](https://x.com/ZsoltLenkei/status/1818995234258157944) by [@ZsoltLenkei](https://x.com/ZsoltLenkei) about the main results of my PhD thesis published as a [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.30.604249v1) on BioRxiv server.

I will explain briefly in the following paragraphes the main points of [Mariani et al. 2024](https://JCMariani.github.io/05_Opioid-brains_Mariani). This study was designed to ellicit the fingerprint of opioids on **Functional Connectivity (FC)**. We leveraged the possibility of **Functional Ultrasound Imaging (fUSI)** to image transcranially awake behaving mice to investigate for the first time the influence of opioids on FC in absence of aeasthesia bias.

Middle imaging slice of interest (left: Ultrasound Localisation Microscopy, right: overlay of Power Doppler with the Allen template). Bottom: experimental design, the drug is injected after a $$20min$$ of baseline, we compute differences of FC with matching saline injections, significant difference in seed-based maps show the influence of morphin on the FC.</small>
