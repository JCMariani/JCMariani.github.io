This post is adapted from this [**X** thread](https://x.com/ZsoltLenkei/status/1818995234258157944) by [@ZsoltLenkei](https://x.com/ZsoltLenkei) about the main results of my PhD thesis published as a [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.30.604249v1) on BioRxiv server.

I will explain briefly in the following paragraphes the main points of [Mariani et al. 2024](https://JCMariani.github.io/05_Opioid-brains_Mariani). This study was designed to ellicit the fingerprint of opioids on **Functional Connectivity (FC)**. We leveraged the possibility of **Functional Ultrasound Imaging (fUSI)** to image transcranially awake behaving mice and investigate for the first time the influence of opioids on FC in absence of anaesthesic bias. Using mice we could demonstrate the causal involvement of the **$$mu$$-Opioid Receptor (MOP)** in the observed FC dysconnectivity pattern.

<small>**Fig1.** Top: imaging setup for awake transcranial fUSI on behaving mice in the [Neurotar](https://www.neurotar.com/) head fixed system. Middle imaging slice of interest (left: Ultrasound Localisation Microscopy, right: overlay of Power Doppler with the Allen template). Bottom: experimental design, the drug is injected after a $$20min$$ of baseline, we compute differences of FC with matching saline injections, significant difference in seed-based maps show the influence of morphine on the FC.</small>

<small>**Fig2.** Top: Correlation matrix, low triangle average correlation after the injection of morphine, top triangle displays the difference only for the edges with a significant change as compared to baseline. Middle: significant edges displayed as a network. Bottom: seed based maps showing correlation voxel wise with 3 different regions of interest.</small>

<small>**Fig3.** Evolution of the connectome under different conditions, from left to right network computed over 10min windows for two phases of baseline and 6 phases post injection. Top: increasing doses of morphine show a time and dose dependent effect. Middle: the effect is absent in MOP-KO mice, two weeks induction of tolerance by continuous perfusion of morphine reduces the magnitude of change and accelrate its onset. Bottom: similar dysconnectivity profile are observed with different opiates in a dose dependence manner.</small>

<small>**Fig4.** Top: Power spectrum shows a redistribution of power towards higher half of FC band with a relatively fast oscillations peak. Middle: looking at cross corelation we observe the spatio-temporal evolution of correlation structure by introducing delays with the seed signal in SBA. Bottom, looking at ROIs pair cross-correlation, the fast oscillatory phenomenon seems to drive dynamic reconfiguration of FC with different effects depending on baseline profile.</small>

<small>**Fig5.** Top: influence of various opiates on awake mice connectome. Bottom: analgesia profile (time and dose dependence) for the same drugs measured with the hot plate test.</small>

<small>**Fig6.** Top: superposition of regional CBV, FC index, mobility, MOP phosphorylation and analgesia evolution with time after injection of 4 different doses of morphine. Bottom: cross correlation shows two different dynamics, while hyperlocomotion correlates with perfusion, FC correlates with analgesia and MOP phosphorylation.</small>
