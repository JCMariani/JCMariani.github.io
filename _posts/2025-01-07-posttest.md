# Introduction

In this section I detail the methodological aspects regarding the analysis of **Functional Connectivity (FC)** patterns. In the last $$40$$ years, from the first methods developed for **Positon Emission Tomography (PET)** imaging, the field of neuroimaging has strongly standardised its approach. As a result, a set of shared practices has emerged. We present here the theoretical framework behind each of the steps used to compute FC measures. One of the pioneering team in this effort is probably *Karl Friston*'s which proposed the **Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)** software, still broadly used in many publications. Most of the step I described below are inspired from this seminal work. These main steps of the analysis, which can be generalised to most analyses of haemodynamics, can be enumerated as follow:
