My thesis: [Quantification and modelling of functional connectivity perturbation in ultrafast power doppler imaging of the awake mice brain : pharmacological fingerprints on awake brain activity](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04420129) is openly accessible online. If the main chatper is probaly **part V** with the first version of [Mariani et al. 2024](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.30.604249v1). I used this document to detail as much as I could the theoretical context of this study (principles of: **Functional Ultrasound Imaging (fUSI)**, **Functional Connectivity (FC)**, philosophy of data sharing...). I also wrote a lot of technical details for curious fUS experimenters and analysts. I propose here some reading recommendations depending on your interests in the shape of an extended table of content:

# For fUS enthusiastic

I recommend to read in priority:

**Introduction**: 
- **3 fUS** which explains the theory of fUSI signal (the full acquisition pipeline from emission to acquisition)
**Part III**: 
- **8 article** [Bertolo et al. 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33720137/) details acquisition protocols for linear probe in both anaesthetised and awake, task-based and resting states.
- **9 Protocols** emphasizes the awake case as reported in [Mariani et al. 2024](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.30.604249v1) with refinement we developed all along the opioid cannabinoid and psilocybin studies
- **10 Results** shows preliminary results regarding efficiency and controls over our awake preparation
